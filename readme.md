This project deploys the Spring Pet Clinic application on AWS using Terraform for infrastructure automation. The deployment is designed for high availability, scalability, and security. The application is hosted on EC2 instances that are managed by an Auto Scaling Group, enabling the environment to automatically scale in or out based on traffic demands. These instances are spread across two Availability Zones to ensure fault tolerance and continuous availability.

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is used to distribute incoming traffic evenly among the EC2 instances, ensuring optimal performance and preventing any single instance from becoming a bottleneck. The backend database is managed by Amazon RDS in a multi-AZ configuration, which provides high availability and automatic failover capabilities. Database credentials and other sensitive information are securely stored and managed using AWS Secrets Manager, which helps to maintain secure and compliant access controls.

Terraform serves as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments by defining the infrastructure components in code. This approach ensures that the infrastructure is version-controlled and can be easily replicated or modified. Additionally, security measures are implemented using AWS IAM roles and security groups to control access to resources, while monitoring and logging are handled by AWS CloudWatch to provide insights into application performance and infrastructure health. This architecture leverages AWS best practices to provide a resilient, secure, and scalable environment for the Spring Pet Clinic application.
